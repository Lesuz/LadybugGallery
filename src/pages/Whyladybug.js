        <h1>Why Lady Bugs?</h1>
        <p>Ladybug (<em>Coccinellidae</em>) is a small beetle which many recognize. Unlike what the name tells us, 
          ladybugs are not classified as true bugs and are therefore called ladybird beetles or lady beetles 
          in the study of insects.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ladybugs are mostly red, yellow or orange with small black dots or sports on their back, on their wings. 
        Depending on the subfamily of the ladybug, their pattern and shape are different but most subfamilies do 
        follow the pattern of the ladybug many of us know.
